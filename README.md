## DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
**Description of the dataset**

**: Employee attrition stats**
![{992F46A0-DF54-489C-BAD1-0A6B699CDC58}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfad7048-1e3f-42af-be26-ed8df0eb1a73)
-- **16.1%** of employees are no longer with the company (attrition).
-- **83.9%** are still employed.
-- This is your overall attrition rate‚Äîa critical business metric in HR analytics.
-- A healthy attrition rate varies by industry, but 16.1% could indicate potential concerns, especially in a service-driven sector like hospitality.

**Attrition by department**

![{1B1ED6DF-7D6E-43E8-8E91-0FDE06A4CD6D}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3211d78-53b4-4d8d-8415-d32553ccdc6d)
--Most attrition is happening in R&D, followed by Sales.
--Human Resources has the least attrition.
-- This may indicate role-based dissatisfaction, leadership issues, or a misalignment between job expectations and daily tasks in R&D and Sales.

**Attrition rate by Job satisfaction**
![{DD27EEBD-7BA0-47F9-B13C-3CD3B8047A08}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19ee93f4-d1a2-49d1-8e34-e5c19ef78ce2)
--Employees who seem satisfied (rated 'Good') may still be at risk, indicating a need for deeper qualitative feedback.
--Focus on converting ‚ÄúGood‚Äù to ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù by providing better career development, rewards, and work-life balance.
--"Neutral‚Äù employees are a critical segment to target for engagement initiatives‚Äîthey're the easiest to retain or lose.

**Correlation matrix of the dataset**

-- Confirming our findings in the scatterplot above, MonthlyIncome has a strongpositive correlation to Total Working Years of **0.77**.
-- Additionally, YearsAtCompany has a strong positive association with YearsWithCurrManager **(correlation = 0.77)**as well as with YearsInCurrentRole **(correlation = 0.76)**.
-- There are no variables with a correlation above **0.8**,indicating a potential collinearity issue.

## Hypothesis Testing
-- ** Z - Test**
![{0EBF0E6D-4455-4AC2-B6FC-078556957AD6}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87c15761-ffbb-4acb-b86a-c5c13a23e0a6)
--Z-statistic:
--ÔÇ∑ The Z-statistic is -7.4826, indicating how many standard deviations the difference between the means of the two groups is away from zero.
-- ÔÇ∑ A negative value suggests that the Monthly Income of Former Employees is significantly lower than that of Current Employees.

-- P-value:
-- ÔÇ∑ The p-value is 7.2831e-14, an extremely small value.
-- ÔÇ∑ This low p-value provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis, indicating a statistically significant difference in Monthly Income between the two groups.

**Chi-Square Test of Independence**

-- Attrition and Education are independent (p-value = 0.55).
-- Attrition and Gender are independent (p-value = 0.29).
-- Attrition and PerformanceRating are independent (p-value = 0.99).
-- Attrition and RelationshipSatisfaction are independent (p-value = 0.15).

- üîç Women in HR and men in Sales show higher attrition risk.
- üî• Random Forest model achieved:
  - **Validation Accuracy**: 83.6%
  - **Test Accuracy**: 84.2%

  - Total years of work
  - Distance from home
  - Manager relationship

 ##   CONCLUSION
--This study presents a comprehensive examination of employee attrition within the organization, revealing several critical insights and patterns:
-- The overall attrition rate of 16% indicates a dynamic workforce, with distinct trends across departments. Research & Development shows significantly higher turnover, while Human Resources maintains lower attrition levels.
-- Gender-based differences were observed: attrition is higher among women in HR and men in Sales, suggesting department-gender interactions may influence turnover.
-- Interestingly, a majority of departing employees reported job satisfaction, which implies that factors beyond contentment‚Äîsuch as compensation disparities, lack of growth, or work-life imbalance‚Äîplay a role in their decision to leave.
-- Salary inequities across genders and roles emerged as a potential area for HR intervention. A Z-test on Monthly Income confirmed a statistically significant difference between former and current employees.
--Strong correlations were observed between MonthlyIncome and TotalWorkingYears, reinforcing the influence of experience on compensation‚Äîand potentially on attrition.

--Predictive modeling using Random Forest identified key factors impacting attrition, including:
-Monthly Income
-Age
-Years at Company
-Overtime
-Stock Options
-Job Satisfaction
-Departmental Affiliation
--The model performed robustly across both validation and test sets, achieving high accuracy and AUC, supporting its use as an early-warning tool for HR professionals.

##  SUGGESTIONS
--**Tailored Retention Strategies**
-Develop targeted retention programs based on the identified factors influencing attrition, such as work-life balance, job satisfaction, and overtime. Customize initiatives for different departments to address specific concerns.
-- **Employee Engagement Initiatives**
  -Implement initiatives to boost overall jobsatisfaction, considering the positive correlation between satisfaction and retention. Regular feedback mechanisms, recognition programs, and professional development
opportunities can contribute to a more engaged workforce.
-- **Flexible Work Arrangements**
- Recognize the impact of work-life balance on attrition. Explore flexible work arrangements, remote work options, or compressed workweeks to accommodate diverse employee needs and promote a healthier worklife balance.
-- ** Overtime Management**
   -Address concerns related to working overtime, as indicated by its significance in predicting attrition. Evaluate workload distribution, assess resource allocation, and consider measures to manage and minimize overtime demands.
-- **Competitive Compensation**
  -Given the importance of monthly income in predicting attrition, ensure that the company's salary structure remains competitive within the industry. Regularly review and adjust compensation packages to reflect market trends.
